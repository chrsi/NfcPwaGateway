# PwaGateway
A simple Gateway for opening Progressive Web Applications on Android Devices

To launch a PWA from the browser a link from a different domain is required.
With this gateway application hosted under https://chrsi.github.io/PwaGateway you can simply open any PWA except the ones hosted on github.

# Documentation
## PWA Location
Just provide a pwa parameter that specifies the location of your PWA. If you have a PWA on your phone linked with this url, it will launch automatically.

e.g. this will redirect you to the "https://www.orf.at" application:

`https://chrsi.github.io/PwaGateway?pwa=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.orf.at`
